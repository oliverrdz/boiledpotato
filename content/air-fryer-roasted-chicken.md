## 🍗 Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prepare the chicken
- Pat the chicken dry with paper towels (crispier skin).
- Rub all over with olive oil or butter.
- Season generously, including under the wings and inside the cavity.
- Optional: Stuff the cavity with **half a lemon** and **2 crushed garlic cloves**.

### 2️⃣ Preheat the air fryer  
- Preheat to **190°C (375°F)** for 5 minutes.

### 3️⃣ Cook breast-side down  
- Place the chicken **breast-side down** in the air fryer basket.

### 4️⃣ Air fry  
**Total time: 50–60 minutes** (depends on size).

Cook in two stages:
- **Stage 1:** 190°C for **30 minutes**, breast-side down.
- **Stage 2:** Flip the chicken breast-side up and cook **20–30 minutes** more.

### 5️⃣ Check doneness  
- Use a thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh: **75°C (165°F)** = done.
- If the top browns too quickly, lower heat to **180°C** for the last 10–15 minutes.

### 6️⃣ Rest  
- Let rest **10 minutes** before carving so juices settle.

---

## 🍽️ Tips for Best Results
- **Dry skin = crispy skin** → pat very well before seasoning.
- If your air fryer is small, use a **spatchcocked chicken** (cut backbone out and flatten).
- Rub butter under the breast skin for extra flavour.
- For extra crispness: 5 minutes at **200°C** at the end.
