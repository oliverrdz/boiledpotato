## Cooking Instructions

1. **Sauté aromatics**  
   Heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook 3–4 minutes until soft. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.

2. **Season**  
   Add cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir for 30 seconds to bloom the spices.

3. **Cook the beans**  
   Add the refried beans (or mashed beans). Stir to combine. If too thick, add 2–4 tbsp water. Cook 3–5 minutes until creamy.

4. **Warm tortillas**  
   Heat tortillas in a dry skillet for 10–15 seconds each side until soft.

5. **Assemble tacos**  
   Spoon warm refried beans onto each tortilla.  
   Top with cheese, tomato, coriander, jalapeños, and a squeeze of lime.  
   Add salsa or hot sauce.
