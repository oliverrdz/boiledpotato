   - Blend with a small handful of coriander and enough cooking liquid to make a smooth salsa.

2. **Cook the sauce**  
   - Heat oil in a saucepan.  
   - Pour in the blended salsa; simmer 5 minutes.  
   - Add salt, pepper, and optional cumin.

3. **Add the chicharrón**  
   - Add pork cracklings and chicken stock/water.  
   - Simmer 10 minutes until cracklings soften and absorb flavour.

## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- **Fridge:** Store in airtight container for up to 3 days.  
- **Freezer:** Not recommended — cracklings lose texture.  
- **Reheat:** Warm gently on the stove, adding a splash of water if thick.
