## Cooking Instructions (Slow Cooker)
1. **Prepare the base**  
   - Line the slow cooker with banana leaves if using (adds aroma but optional).  
   - Add the sliced red onion to the bottom.

2. **Marinate + Load**  
   - Place pork chunks on top of the onions.  
   - Pour the achiote marinade evenly over the meat, ensuring everything is coated.

3. **Slow cook**  
   - Cook **LOW for 8–10 hours** or **HIGH for 4–5 hours**, until pork is very tender and falls apart easily.

4. **Shred the pork**  
   - Remove pork pieces and shred with two forks.  
   - Return to the slow cooker and mix with the remaining juices.  
   - Adjust seasoning with salt or a squeeze of lime as needed.

5. **Serve**  
   - Ideal with warm corn tortillas, pickled red onions, and a squeeze of lime.  
   - Also excellent over rice or in burrito bowls.
