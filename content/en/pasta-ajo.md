## Cooking Instructions
1. **Cook the pasta**:  
   Add spaghetti to the boiling salted water and cook until just shy of al dente. Reserve a mug of pasta water.

2. **Toast the garlic**:  
   Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-low heat. Add the sliced garlic and cook gently until lightly golden—avoid burning. Add chilli flakes if using.

3. **Build the sauce**:  
   Add butter and swirl until melted. Add a splash of pasta water to emulsify.

4. **Combine**:  
   Add the drained pasta directly into the garlic oil mixture. Toss vigorously, adding small amounts of pasta water until it forms a glossy sauce that coats the noodles.

5. **Finish**:  
   Add parsley, lemon zest (optional), black pepper, and Parmesan. Toss again. Taste and adjust salt.

6. **Serve immediately** with extra cheese and pepper on top.

## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- **Fridge:** Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.  
- **Reheating:** Reheat gently in a frying pan with a splash of water or olive oil to loosen the sauce. Avoid microwaving for too long as it dries out.  
- **Freezer:** Not recommended; texture will suffer.
