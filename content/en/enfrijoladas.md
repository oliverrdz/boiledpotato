## Meal Prep Steps

2. Drain beans but keep 1–2 tbsp of the liquid for blending.  
3. Warm tortillas in a dry pan or microwave so they don’t crack when folded.  
4. Set toppings ready: crumble cheese, chop coriander, slice remaining onion.

## Cooking Instructions

### 1. Make the bean sauce
1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  
2. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft (3–4 minutes).  
3. Add garlic, cumin, and paprika (if using), cook 30 seconds.  
4. Add black beans, bean liquid, and the water/stock.  
5. Simmer for 5 minutes, then blend until smooth and pourable.  
6. Season with salt & pepper. Thin with more water if needed—the sauce should coat a spoon but still flow.

### 2. Warm the tortillas
1. Heat a pan with a teaspoon of oil.  
2. Warm each tortilla lightly on both sides (about 10 seconds).  
3. Keep them wrapped in a towel so they stay soft.

### 3. Assemble
1. Dip each tortilla into the hot bean sauce.  
2. Fold into quarters (or roll like enchiladas) and set on a plate.  
3. Repeat for all tortillas.

### 4. Serve
Top with:
- Crumbled feta/queso fresco  
- Sliced onion  
- Coriander  
- A drizzle of sour cream if desired

## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- **Bean sauce:** Store separately in an airtight container for up to 3 days.  
- **Tortillas:** Keep wrapped in foil or a sealed bag; reheat in a pan.  
- **Reheating enfrijoladas:**  
  - Best reheated *before* assembling. Warm bean sauce in a saucepan and dip freshly warmed tortillas.  
  - If already assembled, microwave for 30–45 seconds but textures will be softer.
