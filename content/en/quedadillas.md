## Cooking Instructions
1. **Heat the pan** over medium heat and add a small amount of oil or butter.  
2. Place one tortilla in the pan.  
3. **Layer fillings:** Add cheese first, then vegetables, then your chosen protein. Top with more cheese.  
4. Place a second tortilla on top (or fold if using large tortillas).  
5. Cook 2–3 minutes per side until the tortilla is golden and the cheese is melted.  
6. Remove, rest 1 minute, then cut into wedges.  
7. Serve with salsa, lime and fresh coriander if you like.

## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- **Fridge:** Store cooked quesadillas in an airtight container for up to 2 days.  
- **Reheat:**  
  - Pan: 2–3 minutes each side until crisp.  
  - Air fryer: 3–4 minutes at 180°C.  
  - Microwave: quick but softens tortilla – 30–45 seconds.  
- **Freezing:** Freeze assembled (uncooked) quesadillas between parchment sheets. Cook directly from frozen in a pan on low heat.
