## 🔥 Cooking Instructions (Slow Cooker)

1. **Sear the beef (optional but adds flavor):**  
   Heat a little oil in a pan and brown each side of the beef chunks. Transfer to the slow cooker.  
   > If you want a faster prep, skip searing — the recipe still works great.

2. **Layer the aromatics:**  
   Add chopped onion, garlic, and chipotle (if using) over the beef.

3. **Add liquids:**  
   Pour in the broth, vinegar, and lime juice.

4. **Season:**  
   Sprinkle the mixed spices over everything. Add the bay leaves.

5. **Cook:**  
   - **Low:** 8–10 hours  
   - **High:** 4–5 hours  
   Beef is ready when it easily shreds with a fork.

6. **Shred & finish:**  
   Remove bay leaves, shred the beef directly in the slow cooker, and mix with the juices.
