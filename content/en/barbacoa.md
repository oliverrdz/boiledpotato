## Cooking Instructions (Slow Cooker)

2. **Add the beef:** Place beef chunks on top of the onion.  
3. **Add marinade:** Pour the chipotle-spice mixture over the beef.  
4. **Add liquids:** Pour beef stock around the meat, not directly over it. Add bay leaves.  
5. **Cook:**  
   - Low for **8–9 hours**, or  
   - High for **4–5 hours**  
6. **Shred the meat:** Once tender, remove the beef and shred with forks.  
7. **Return to sauce:** Stir shredded beef back into the slow cooker juices and let it absorb flavour for 10 minutes on warm.  
8. **Serve:** With warm tortillas, rice, coriander, lime wedges, or use in burritos or bowls.
