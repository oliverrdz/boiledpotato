## Meal Prep Steps
1. **Make the pico de gallo:** Combine tomatoes, onion, coriander, jalapeño, lime juice, and a pinch of salt. Mix and set aside.  
2. **Prepare the steak marinade:** In a bowl mix olive oil, garlic, lime juice, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper.  
3. **Coat the steak:** Add the steak to the marinade and rest for at least 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours in the fridge).  
4. **Warm the tortillas:** Wrap in foil or keep ready to heat in a dry pan.

## Cooking Instructions
1. Heat a cast-iron or heavy frying pan over **high heat** until very hot.  
2. Add the steak (whole or sliced) and sear 2–3 minutes per side if whole, or 1–2 minutes if sliced. You want strong browning.  
3. Remove the steak and rest 5 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain if cooked whole.  
4. Heat tortillas in a dry pan for 20–30 seconds per side until soft and flexible.  
5. Assemble tacos: tortilla → steak → pico de gallo → squeeze of lime → hot sauce if desired.

## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- **Cooked steak:** Store in an airtight container for up to **3 days**.  
- **Pico de gallo:** Best fresh, but keeps 1 day in the fridge.  
- **Reheating:** Warm steak in a pan over medium heat for 1–2 minutes or microwave briefly. Warm tortillas in a pan just before serving.  
- **Freezing:** Cooked steak can be frozen up to **2 months**. Do not freeze pico de gallo.
