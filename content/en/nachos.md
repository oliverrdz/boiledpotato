## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- Nachos are best eaten immediately; they lose crispness once cooled.  
- If storing:  
  - Keep toppings separate and store the baked chips/cheese in an airtight container for up to 1 day.  
- Reheat in the oven at 170°C for 5 minutes to crisp again.  
- Add fresh toppings after reheating.
