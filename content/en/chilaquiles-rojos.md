## Cooking Instructions

### 1. Make the Red Sauce
1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan.  
2. Add chopped onion and sauté until soft.  
3. Add garlic and optional chillies; cook 1 minute.  
4. Add tomatoes (or tinned tomatoes), oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper.  
5. Simmer 10 minutes.  
6. Blend until smooth; adjust seasoning.

### 2. Prepare the Tortilla Chips
**Option A: Fry (traditional)**
1. Heat oil in a pan.  
2. Fry tortilla triangles until crisp and lightly golden.  
3. Drain on paper towels and salt lightly.

**Option B: Bake (lighter)**
1. Toss triangles with a little oil and salt.  
2. Bake at 180°C for 10–12 min until crisp.

### 3. Combine
1. Return the sauce to a pan on low heat.  
2. Add chips to the sauce and toss to coat.  
   - For **saucier chilaquiles**, add a splash of water or stock.  
   - For **crispier chilaquiles**, add chips at the last minute and toss quickly.

### 4. Serve
Top with:  
- Fried or scrambled eggs  
- Crumbled feta/queso fresco  
- Sliced avocado  
- Coriander  
- A squeeze of lime  
- Sour cream

## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- **Sauce:** Stores in the fridge 3–4 days or freezer 2–3 months.  
- **Chips mixed with sauce:** Best eaten immediately; they soften quickly.  
- **To reheat:** Warm the sauce gently in a pan and add fresh chips.
