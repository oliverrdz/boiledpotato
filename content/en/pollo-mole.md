## Cooking Instructions

### 1. Sauté the aromatics  
- Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pot over medium heat.  
- Add onions and cook 5 minutes until softened.  
- Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.  
- Add jalapeños if using.

### 2. Brown the chicken  
- Add chicken thighs to the pot and lightly brown on both sides (2–3 minutes per side).  
- They don’t need to be cooked through.

### 3. Build the mole sauce  
- Add the entire jar of mole paste into the pot.  
- Pour in **750–900 ml** stock or water.  
- Stir until the paste dissolves into a smooth sauce.

### 4. Simmer  
- Bring to a gentle simmer.  
- Cover and cook for **25–35 minutes** (boneless) or **40–50 minutes** (bone-in), until chicken is tender.  
- Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.  
- If sauce thickens too much, add a splash of water.

### 5. Adjust seasoning  
- Taste and add salt or pepper as needed.  
- If you want it sweeter (common in mole), add **1–2 tsp sugar**.  
- If you want it richer, add a small piece of dark chocolate.

### 6. Serve  
- Serve over rice or with warm tortillas.  
- Garnish with sesame seeds, coriander, and lime.

## Storage & Reheating Instructions
- **Fridge:** Keeps 3–4 days in an airtight container.  
- **Freezer:** Freeze up to 3 months; thaw overnight before reheating.  
- **Reheat:** Warm in a pot over low heat with a splash of water to loosen the sauce. Microwave in 1-minute intervals, stirring between each.
