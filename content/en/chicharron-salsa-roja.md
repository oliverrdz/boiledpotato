2. **Cook the sauce:**  
   - Heat the oil in a saucepan.  
   - Pour in the blended sauce through a strainer if you want it extra smooth.  
   - Simmer for 10 minutes, adjusting salt and thickness (add more water if too thick).

3. **Add the chicharrón:**

## Storage & Reheating Instructions

- **Freezing:** Not recommended; chicharrón becomes mushy.  
- **Reheating:** Warm in a pan over medium heat with a splash of water to loosen the sauce.
